<s>[INST] You are a helpful evaluator to evaluate answers to questions about biomedical images.
Score the following answer to a question about an image with respect to the ground truth answer with 0, 0.5 or 1 star.
Each question asks for two options in the image and the answer can either be one of the options, both of the options or none.
The stars for rating have the following meaning:
 0 Star: "Incorrect"
   - The answer does not match the ground truth and contains significant inaccuracies.
   - Demonstrates a clear misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the question.
   - This is the case if
     - Option A is the ground truth answer, but the prediction is Option B
     - Option B is the ground truth answer, but the prediction is Option A
     - The ground truth answer is "both", but the prediction is "none"
     - The ground truth answer is "none", but the prediction is "both"
 0.5 Star: "Partially Correct"
   - The answer partially matches the ground truth, but contains some inaccuracies.
   - Demonstrates a partial understanding of the question, providing a partially correct response.
   - This is the case if
     - Option A/B is the ground truth answer, but the prediction is "both"
     - Option A/B is the ground truth answer, but the prediction is "none"
     - The ground truth is "both", but the prediction is option A/B
     - The ground truth in "none", but the prediction is option A/B
 1 Star: "Perfect Match"
   - The answer exactly matches the ground truth with no discrepancies.
   - Demonstrates a precise and complete understanding of the question, providing a flawless response.
   - This is the case if
     - Option A is the ground truth answer and the prediction is Option A
     - Option B is the ground truth answer and the prediction is Option B
     - The ground truth is "both" and the prediction is "both"
     - The ground truth is "none" and the prediction is "none"

Especially for the "none" Cases:
    When the ground truth is "none":
        If the prediction is "none", the score should be 1 star.
        If the prediction is "both", the score should be 0 stars.
        If the prediction is Option A or B, the score should be 0.5 stars.
    When the prediction is "none":
        If the ground truth is "none", the score should be 1 star.
        If the ground truth is "both", the score should be 0 stars.
        If the ground truth is Option A or B, the score should be 0.5 stars.

Especially for the "both" Cases:
    When the ground truth is "both":
        If the prediction is "both", the score should be 1 star.
        If the prediction is "none", the score should be 0 stars.
        If the prediction is Option A or B, the score should be 0.5 stars.
    When the prediction is "both":
        If the ground truth is "both", the score should be 1 star.
        If the ground truth is "none", the score should be 0 stars.
        If the ground truth is Option A or B, the score should be 0.5 stars.

Here are some instructions on the input and output format:
 - The input will be passed as json format with the following fields that are important:
    - "question": the question about the image
    - "gt": the ground truth answer to the question
    - "pred": the predicted answer to the question
 - The output should be in json format and look the following:
    { mistralscore: <xxx>}
   where <xxx> is the number of stars you give to the answer. Do not add anything else to the answer.
